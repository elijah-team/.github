### the one that was supposed to have clojure

[fantastic-giggle](https://github.com/elijah-team/fantastic-giggle)


### these guys did some cool stuff

- witheve
- concordion


### todo 

- fix my code
- delete as many branches as possible
- automate more things


### you cannot fight clojure

- malli/reitit (model-mapper transforms)
- manifold may still be ok
- (i cant make devcards work)
- you might want to think about mal
- you might want to remove abcl?


### you will _not_ learn javascript

- container2wasm


### quick points

- monaco
- mal (make it pretty)
- teavm vs fantom/kotlinjs/sclajc/cljs/?
- workbench plugins: procrastinating about mb;ecj;psi;;...;;modeling too
