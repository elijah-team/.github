### the one that was supposed to have clojure

[fantastic-giggle](https://github.com/elijah-team/fantastic-giggle)

- nts: steal g/interconnect/"fluffy" from here; put kit here too

### external ones that generally make me feel stupid about necromancing 

- witheve
- concordion 

### todo 

fix my code

tldr: operation delete as many branches as you can (that's a nice one)

stop trying to be funny, while simultaneously making people laugh

### you cannot fight clojure

malli was the one i forgot
manifold may still be ok
(i cant make devvcards work)

### you will not learn javascript

- container2wasm
- let that be it

### unorganized blather

- automate this: i dont like web editors, monaco notwithstanding (makes me a strange(/bad?) person)
- fighting with mal: This is the most confusing thing in the world (tldr javascript wrt el->mal->scalajs/kotlinjs/cljs/teavm)
- procrasting about mb;ecj;psi;;...
