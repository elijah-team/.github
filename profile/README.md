### the one that was supposed to have clojure

[fantastic-giggle](https://github.com/elijah-team/fantastic-giggle)

- nts: steal g/interconnect/"fluffy" from here; put kit here too


### these guys did some cool stuff

- witheve
- concordion
- (the sidebar thing: hypothesis?)
- msl (site down...) + john (in c#)


### todo 

fix my code

delete as many branches as possible

automate more things


### you cannot fight clojure

malli was the one i forgot
reitit was the one i was thinking of when i forgot the other one
manifold may still be ok
(i cant make devcards work)


### you will not learn javascript

- container2wasm
- let that be it


### quick points

- monaco
- mal (esp js version)
- teavm vs fantom/[holograph](https://www.holograph.so/)/kotlinjs/sclajc/cljs/?
- elixir (duh, but out of scope for fluffy (fluffy == java))
- if elixir then roc, zig, ?
- javascript wrt el->mal->scalajs/kotlinjs/cljs/teavm
- workbench plugins: procrasting about mb;ecj;psi;;...;;modeling too
- documenting automerge
